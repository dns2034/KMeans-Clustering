# K-Means Clustering Example

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates the K-Means clustering algorithm using synthetic data.

## Contents

- **kmeans_example.py**: The main Python script that generates data, applies K-Means clustering, and visualizes the results.

## Description

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Generates synthetic data with 300 samples grouped into 4 clusters using the `make_blobs` function.
2. Applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to the generated data.
3. Visualizes the data points, coloring them based on their assigned clusters, and marks the centroids of each cluster.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries: numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn
2. Run the script


## Output

The script will display a scatter plot showing the clustered data points and their centroids.

Feel free to explore and modify the code!
